The American Medical Association has formally classified compulsive bionic augmentation and modification—sometimes called 'overmodding'—as a behavioral addiction.

Clinics in major cities have already begun offering 'augmentation detox' programs focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy and implant disabling. Manufacturers like Uncanny have resisted the classification, calling it 'stigmatizing' and potentially harmful to innovation.
